# FlyingFree
Code idea meant to predict the sudden increases in the number of passengers before a flight.

Usage:

  -The file needs to read the file 'Data' and import pandas library.

  -Once the file is loaded, it will display the data as a DataFrame (please, use the command)

  -The code will request the filters you want to apply in order to analyze specific flights that share similar conditions (date, time, flight number... And combinations of said filters).

  -Once the filters are applied, the code will display a filtered DataFrame with only those flights that meet the specific criteria you requested.

  -Finally it will calculate the percentaje of last minute increases for those flights applying a simple percentage function.
